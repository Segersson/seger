# Seger Chat Prototype

This is a simple prototype for a Swedish chat interface about the upcoming Social Services Act. The page consists of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

## Running the chat page

Just open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The page shows a chat box where you can type a question and see the canned answer.

**Important:** the chatbot does not connect to any backend. All answers are hard-coded examples in `script.js`.

## Planned improvements

- Replace hard-coded answers with a real language model or FAQ database
- Add tests and continuous deployment
